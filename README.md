# Jira Cancel Button Confirm

A simple firefox extension that adds a confirm popup when clicking on the "cancel" button, when writing a jira comment. 

If the confirm is refused, nothing happens. Otherwise the normal behavior continue, which is to delete the content and close the comment field.

## Why
Because for some reason, Atlassian decided not to add a confirm before clearing a comment content. They also decided to place the "cancel" button right next to the button to send the comment. 
I'm lost too many comments to that weird behavior to not do something about it, so here we are.
